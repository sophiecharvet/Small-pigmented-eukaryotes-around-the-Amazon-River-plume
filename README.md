This is a summary of the commandlines used in the analyses of data from the study of small pigmented eukaryote assemblages of the western tropical North Atlantic around the Amazon River plume in May 2018.

Samples of seawater were collected from open the ocean water column. 1L was filtered onto 0.2µm PC filters, which were then stored in a mixture of TE-glycerol (0.5mL) and seawater sample (4mL), vortexed to resuspend cells and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. From these samples, cells were analysed on a flow cytometer, to dientify and sort populations that composed the small (≤ 5µm) pigmented eukaryote communities. 18S rRNA gene were then sequenced from these sorted populations.

The scripts (commandlines) presented here were used to analyse the reads produced by three sequencing runs on an Illumina HiSeq platform.
